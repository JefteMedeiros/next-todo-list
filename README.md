This is my Next.JS Todo-List!

It's objective, is to be simple, have good coding practices and to cause a good user experience.
It was styled with Tailwind CSS, my favorite choice for producticity for mid-long term projects.

It has features like search, add and delete task (CRUD). Hope you enjoy :D
